Pricing your SaaS solution based on transactions rather than active patient days can provide a compelling alternative, especially if it aligns better with the value your service provides or if it can incentivize higher usage levels. Here’s a breakdown of how you might structure a transaction-based pricing model and a competitive analysis.

Transaction-Based Pricing Model
Define a Transaction:

A transaction could be defined as any single action that has a financial impact, such as:
Renting or selling equipment.
Processing a claim with an insurer.
Completing a patient intake.
Updating inventory records.
Pricing Options:

You can set a fixed fee per transaction, tiered pricing based on volume, or a combination:
Fixed Fee Model: Charge a flat fee per transaction. For example, $1.00 per transaction.
Example Calculation: If a DME company processes 1,000 transactions in a month:
Monthly Fee: 1,000 transactions x $1.00 = $1,000.
Tiered Pricing Model:
Tier 1: $0.80 per transaction for 1-500 transactions.
Tier 2: $0.70 per transaction for 501-1000 transactions.
Tier 3: $0.60 per transaction for 1001+ transactions.
This model rewards higher usage with lower per-transaction fees.
Example Calculation:

If a DME company had 1,200 transactions (e.g., orders processed, claims submitted), the monthly cost could be calculated as follows:
For the first 500 transactions: 500 x $0.80 = $400.
For the next 500 transactions: 500 x $0.70 = $350.
For the last 200 transactions: 200 x $0.60 = $120.
Total Monthly Fee: $400 + $350 + $120 = $870.
Competitive Considerations
Assess Current Competitors' Pricing:

Competitors charging based on active patient days often emphasize stability and predictable monthly costs. Understand the number of transactions they typically generate per patient day to gauge your pricing attractively.
Highlight Value Proposition:

Emphasize the financial incentives of a transaction-based model, especially for companies with fluctuating patient counts or those that are growing quickly. If they don’t consistently have high active patient days, your model could be more cost-effective.
Offer Flexible Pricing Options:

Consider offering hybrid pricing where clients can choose between active patient days or transaction-based pricing. This allows DME companies to select the model that they find most beneficial based on their operational dynamics.
Incentives for Long-term Contracts:

Provide discounted rates for companies that commit to longer contract terms or higher transaction volumes. This can help ensure steady revenue while providing savings for customers.
Consider Industry Standards:

Conduct research to benchmark your transaction fees against industry standards. If you can provide a compelling case showing that your pricing model is fair and beneficial for the companies that rent or sell equipment frequently, it may sway clients to choose your solution over competitors.
Conclusion
Transitioning to a transaction-based pricing model can help you appeal to different segments of the market, particularly those that experience variability in patient volume and transaction frequency. By clearly articulating the benefits and ensuring your pricing structure meets the needs of your potential customers, you can competitively position your SaaS solution in the HME/DME marketplace.
