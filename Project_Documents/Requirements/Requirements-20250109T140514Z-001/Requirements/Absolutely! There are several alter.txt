Absolutely! There are several alternative pricing structures you can consider beyond active patient days and transaction-based models. Here are a few options that may align with your value proposition and target customers:

Alternative Pricing Models
Subscription-Based Pricing:

Charge a monthly or annual subscription fee that covers access to the SaaS platform regardless of the number of patients or transactions. This could be a straightforward flat fee or vary by tier based on features.
Example:
Basic Plan: $500/month for essential features.
Professional Plan: $1,000/month for advanced features and integrations.
Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for large organizations with specific needs.
Usage-Based Pricing:

Similar to transaction-based pricing but focused on resource consumption (e.g., storage, data usage). This can be beneficial if your solution involves heavy data processing or storage.
Example:
Charge customers based on the volume of data processed or the number of reports generated.
Value-Based Pricing:

Set prices based on the perceived value your solution provides to the customer rather than costs or transactions. This requires a deep understanding of your customer's ROI.
Example: If your solution saves a DME company $10,000 annually, you might charge $2,000 to $3,000, exemplifying significant value for their investment.
Freemium Model:

Offer a basic version of your solution for free, with premium features available through paid plans. This can attract users who may convert to paying customers later.
Example: Basic features are free, while advanced functionalities like AI agents or analytics tools are priced starting at $500/month.
Per User Pricing:

Charge a fee based on the number of users accessing the system. This model is often popular for SaaS solutions in any industry.
Example:
$50/user/month. For a company with 20 users, the total monthly cost would be $1,000.
Flat Rate Per Client:

Instead of basing charges on transactions or patient days, charge per client or per facility that the DME company operates. This can be appealing for multi-location providers.
Example: A flat rate of $1,500 per location per month.
Tiered Pricing by Features:

Create tiers based on the specific features and capabilities included. This allows smaller companies access at a lower price while offering more significant functionalities at higher tiers.
Example:
Tier 1: Essential features at $500/month.
Tier 2: Advanced features and integrations at $1,000/month.
Tier 3: Full features and customization at $1,500/month.
Performance-Based Pricing:

Charge based on the outcomes your solution delivers. This could link payments to metrics like reduced costs, improved patient satisfaction, or increased efficiency.
Example: You could agree on a percentage of cost savings your platform generates for the DME company.
Conclusion
Each of these alternative pricing models offers unique advantages and may appeal to different segments of the DME market. It’s essential to carefully consider your target audience's needs, preferences, and operational realities when determining the best pricing strategy. Hybrid models combining elements of these pricing structures may also appeal to a broader range of customers.
