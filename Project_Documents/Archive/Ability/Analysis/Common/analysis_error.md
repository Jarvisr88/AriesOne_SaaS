# Error Class Analysis

## 1. Needs Analysis
- **Business Requirements**: Manage error information for applications, ensuring accurate and efficient error handling.
- **Feature Requirements**: Serialize error data, including code, message, and details, to XML.
- **User Requirements**: Operates behind the scenes, not directly interacted with by end-users.
- **Technical Requirements**: Ensure accurate handling and serialization of error attributes.
- **Integration Points**: Interfaces with systems requiring error management.

## 2. Component Analysis
- **Code Structure**: Contains properties for Code, Message, and an array of Details, with XML serialization attributes.
- **Dependencies**: Utilizes .NET's System.Xml.Serialization for XML handling.
- **Business Logic**: Acts as a structured container for error data.
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Not applicable.
- **Data Flow**: Facilitates data flow from application components to systems requiring error information.
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling; consider adding validation for error data.

## 3. Business Process Documentation
- **Process Flows**: Supports processes involving error management.
- **Decision Points**: Determines the inclusion of specific error attributes based on system needs.
- **Business Rules**: Must comply with standards for error management.
- **User Interactions**: Indirectly influences system interactions by structuring error data.
- **System Interactions**: Engages with systems requiring error management.

## 4. API Analysis
- **Endpoints**: Supports APIs requiring error data.
- **Request/Response Formats**: Utilizes XML for data serialization.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Ensures secure data handling.
- **Error Handling**: Should include mechanisms for handling serialization errors.
- **Rate Limiting**: Not applicable.
