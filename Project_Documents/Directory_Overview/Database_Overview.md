# Database Module Overview

The Database module represents a critical infrastructure component of the DME/HME operations system, focusing on database configuration, connection management, and system administration. Through detailed analysis of both legacy and modernized components, we have mapped out a system that transitions from Windows-specific ODBC management to a platform-agnostic database configuration solution.
