# Modernization Plan

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

### Codebase Analysis
- Conduct a detailed review of the legacy code to identify key components, dependencies, and areas that need updating.
- Document the current functionalities, business logic, and data flows to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the existing system.

### Technology Alignment
- Map legacy components to the new tech stack, determining how each will be transitioned or replaced.
- Plan the architecture redesign to support microservices and cloud integration.
- Identify opportunities for integrating AI agents to assist users with business process execution, such as order placement.

## Phase 2: Frontend Modernization
- Proceed with the implementation as planned, focusing on UI redesign, state management, and component development using React, TypeScript, and associated technologies.

## Phase 3: Backend Modernization

### API Development
- Transition backend services to FastAPI, ensuring efficient API design and implementation.
- Use Uvicorn as the ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.

### Database Schema Integration
- Analyze the legacy schema, including tables, stored procedures, functions, triggers, and views.
- Design a new database schema in PostgreSQL, incorporating legacy elements as needed.
- Use SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for managing schema migrations.

### Data Validation and Configuration
- Employ Pydantic for data validation and Python-dotenv for managing environment variables.

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- Implement integration and testing strategies as outlined, ensuring comprehensive coverage and quality assurance.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring
- Proceed with deployment and monitoring strategies as planned, leveraging CI/CD pipelines and cloud services for scalability and performance.
