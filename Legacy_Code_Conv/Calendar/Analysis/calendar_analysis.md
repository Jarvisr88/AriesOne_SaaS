# Calendar Module Analysis

## 1. Needs Analysis

### Business Requirements

The Calendar module serves as a crucial component in the DME/HME operations management system. At its core, the module needs to provide comprehensive calendar event management capabilities tailored specifically for healthcare equipment management workflows. This includes the ability to schedule, track, and manage various types of appointments, from equipment deliveries to maintenance visits and patient consultations.

Integration with Google Calendar is a fundamental requirement, enabling seamless synchronization between our system and the widely-used Google Calendar platform. This integration ensures that staff members can access and manage appointments through either system while maintaining consistency across both platforms. The synchronization must be real-time and bidirectional, ensuring that any changes made in either system are immediately reflected in the other.

The appointment scheduling system must incorporate a robust reminder system to ensure timely execution of scheduled tasks. This is particularly critical in healthcare equipment management, where delays or missed appointments can directly impact patient care. The reminder system should support multiple notification methods to accommodate different user preferences and ensure important appointments are not overlooked.

To accommodate the complex organizational structure of DME/HME operations, the system must support multiple calendars for different departments or purposes. This multi-calendar functionality allows for better organization and management of various types of appointments, such as separate calendars for deliveries, maintenance, customer support, and administrative tasks. Each calendar can be configured with its own set of permissions and visibility settings, ensuring that different teams can effectively manage their specific areas of responsibility while maintaining overall organizational coordination.

### Feature Requirements

The Calendar module must provide a comprehensive set of features to support efficient event management in the DME/HME environment. At the heart of this functionality is the ability to create detailed calendar events. Each event requires essential information including a descriptive title that clearly identifies the appointment type, a detailed description that can contain specific instructions or notes, and precise date and time settings to ensure proper scheduling.

Calendar selection functionality is a critical feature, allowing users to choose the appropriate calendar from their available Google calendars. This ensures that events are properly categorized and visible to the relevant team members. The system must seamlessly integrate with Google's calendar list API to provide users with their full range of accessible calendars, including both primary and secondary calendars they have permission to modify.

The reminder system is designed with healthcare operations in mind, implementing a multi-layered approach to notifications. Each event can be configured with multiple reminder types - email notifications for documentation, popup reminders for immediate attention, and SMS alerts for urgent notifications. The system defaults to a 15-minute reminder setting across all notification types, ensuring that staff members have adequate preparation time while maintaining the flexibility to adjust these settings as needed.

Event duration management is streamlined with a default one-hour time slot, which is typical for most DME/HME appointments. This standardization helps in maintaining consistent scheduling practices while still allowing for customization when needed. To ensure proper planning and prevent scheduling too far in advance, the system enforces date range restrictions, allowing events to be scheduled from the current day up to one year in the future. This limitation helps maintain realistic scheduling practices while providing adequate flexibility for long-term planning.
