# Module Modernization Checklist

## Module Name: Common (Shared Utilities)
Date Started: 2025-01-10
Last Updated: 2025-01-10

## Module Description & Purpose
The Common module provides essential shared utilities and infrastructure components used across the entire AriesOne SaaS platform. It serves as the foundation for standardized error handling, file management, logging, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns. This module ensures consistency and reduces code duplication across the platform.

### Current State
The module is being modernized with a focus on async operations and cloud-native design. Current progress includes:
- File management system (80% complete)
- Error handling framework (75% complete)
- Caching infrastructure (50% complete)
- Logging and monitoring (45% complete)

### Critical Features
1. Centralized error handling
2. File management and storage
3. Caching mechanisms
4. Logging infrastructure
5. Common data models
6. Shared middleware
7. Configuration management

### Technical Debt
- Legacy file handling systems
- Inconsistent error handling
- Local file system dependencies
- Limited caching strategies
- Incomplete documentation

### Integration Points
- Azure Blob Storage
- Redis Cache
- Elasticsearch
- Monitoring systems
- Logging aggregators

### Performance Requirements
- File operations < 200ms
- Cache response time < 10ms
- Log processing < 100ms
- 99.99% service availability
- Error reporting latency < 1s

## Module-Specific Requirements
