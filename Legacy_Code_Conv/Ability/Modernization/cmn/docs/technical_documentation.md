# CMN Module Technical Documentation

## Overview
The CMN (Common Module Network) serves as the networking backbone of the AriesOne SaaS platform. It provides a modern, async-first architecture for handling all network communication, security, and integration protocols between various system components and external services.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Connection Manager**
   - Implements connection pooling
   - Provides circuit breaker pattern
   - Handles retry mechanisms
   - Manages concurrent connections
   - Implements load balancing

2. **Certificate Manager**
   - Integrates with Azure Key Vault
   - Handles automatic certificate renewal
   - Provides SSL/TLS configuration
   - Supports self-signed certificates for development

3. **Telemetry Service**
   - Implements OpenTelemetry integration
   - Provides Prometheus metrics
   - Handles structured logging
   - Manages monitoring dashboards

## Technical Specifications

### Performance
- Network latency: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Throughput: 10,000+ concurrent connections
- Uptime: 99.999%
- Failover time: < 3 seconds

### Security
- TLS 1.3 support
- Automatic certificate management
- Azure Key Vault integration
- Comprehensive security auditing
- Rate limiting implementation

### Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection
- Custom Prometheus metrics
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Structured logging
- Performance dashboards

## Implementation Details

### Connection Pooling
```python
class ConnectionPool:
    """
    Manages a pool of connections with the following features:
    - Dynamic pool sizing
    - Connection reuse
    - Automatic cleanup
    - Health checks
    """
```

### Circuit Breaker
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """
    Implements circuit breaker pattern:
    - Failure threshold tracking
    - State management (Open/Closed/Half-Open)
    - Automatic recovery
    - Failure counting
    """
```

### Certificate Management
```python
class CertificateManager:
    """
    Handles SSL/TLS certificates:
    - Azure Key Vault integration
    - Automatic renewal
    - Certificate validation
    - Development certificates
    """
```

## API Reference

### Connection Management
```python
async with connection_pool.get_connection(endpoint) as conn:
    # Connection is automatically managed
    # Released back to pool when done
```

### Certificate Operations
```python
ssl_context = await certificate_manager.get_certificate("cert-name")
# SSL context ready for use with aiohttp or other clients
```

### Monitoring
```python
await telemetry_service.record_request(
    endpoint="api.example.com",
    method="GET",
    status_code=200,
    duration=0.1
)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Network Settings
POOL_SIZE=10
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30.0
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# Azure Key Vault
AZURE_VAULT_URL=https://your-vault.vault.azure.net
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# Monitoring
OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
ENABLE_METRICS=true
METRICS_PORT=9090
```

## Testing

### Integration Tests
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_network.py
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
pytest tests/performance/benchmark_network.py
```

### Security Audit
```bash
python -m cmn.security.audit
```

## Deployment

### Kubernetes
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cmn-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cmn-service
        image: ariesone/cmn-service:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "256Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Connection Management**
   - Always use connection pooling
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Use circuit breakers for external services

2. **Security**
   - Keep certificates up to date
   - Use strong TLS configuration
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Regular security audits

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Set up alerts
   - Regular performance testing
   - Log important events

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Symptom: "Connection pool exhausted" errors
   - Solution: Increase pool size or reduce connection hold time

2. **Certificate Errors**
   - Symptom: SSL verification failures
   - Solution: Check certificate validity and renewal status

3. **High Latency**
   - Symptom: Response times > 100ms
   - Solution: Check connection pooling and network configuration

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Daily**
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check certificate status
   - Review performance metrics

2. **Weekly**
   - Run performance tests
   - Review security logs
   - Check resource usage

3. **Monthly**
   - Full security audit
   - Certificate renewal check
   - Performance optimization
