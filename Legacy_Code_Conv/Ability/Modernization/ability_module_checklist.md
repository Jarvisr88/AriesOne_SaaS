# Module Modernization Checklist

## Module Name: Ability (Main Module)
Date Started: 2025-01-10
Last Updated: 2025-01-10

## Module Description & Purpose
The Ability module is the core engine of our healthcare eligibility verification system. It serves as the primary interface between healthcare providers and multiple payer systems, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers. This module handles the critical task of verifying patient insurance eligibility in real-time, managing credentials for various payer systems, and orchestrating the verification workflow.

### Current State
The module is currently undergoing modernization from a legacy .NET implementation to a modern Python-based microservices architecture. Key components being modernized include:
- Credential management system (70% complete)
- Payer system integrations (40% complete)
- Eligibility verification engine (30% complete)
- Real-time processing system (20% complete)

### Critical Features
1. Multi-payer system support
2. Real-time eligibility verification
3. Secure credential storage
4. Audit logging
5. Rate limiting and throttling
6. Error handling and recovery
7. Performance monitoring

### Technical Debt
- Legacy credential storage needs encryption upgrade
- Monolithic architecture being broken into microservices
- Missing automated tests
- Outdated documentation
- Manual scaling processes

### Integration Points
- Medicare HETS system
- Medicaid portals
- Private payer APIs
- Internal authentication services
- Logging and monitoring systems

### Performance Requirements
- Eligibility checks: < 3 seconds
- 99.99% uptime for critical services
- Support for 100,000 daily verifications
- < 0.1% error rate

## Module-Specific Requirements
- Integration with Medicare eligibility systems
- Support for multiple payer systems
- Real-time eligibility verification
- Secure credential management
- Integration with external APIs
- Support for multiple facility types
- Audit trail for all verifications
- Rate limiting for external API calls

## Current Progress
### Completed Items
- Initial database schema design
- Basic model structure
- Core credential management

### In Progress
- Database migrations
- API endpoints
- Service layer implementation

### Pending
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation
- Security audit
