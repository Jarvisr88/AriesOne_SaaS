# Inventory Domain Analysis
## Version: 1.0.0
## Last Updated: 2025-01-12

## 1. Overview
The Inventory domain manages all aspects of equipment and supplies in the HME/DME SaaS application. This includes tracking inventory items, managing serial numbers, handling warehouse operations, and kit management.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Inventory Items
- Master catalog of all equipment and supplies
- Item categorization and classification
- Pricing and cost information
- Rental and sale configurations
- Maintenance schedules
- Reorder points and quantities

### 2.2 Serial Number Management
- Individual equipment tracking
- Equipment status and history
- Maintenance records
- Warranty information
- Certification tracking

### 2.3 Warehouse Management
- Multiple warehouse support
- Bin locations
- Stock levels
- Transfer operations
- Receiving and shipping

### 2.4 Kit Management
- Kit definitions and components
- Kit assembly and disassembly
- Component tracking
- Kit pricing and rental rates

## 3. OOP Design Principles

### 3.1 Inheritance
- BaseInventoryItem abstract class
    - Common attributes for all inventory types
    - Abstract methods for pricing calculations
- Specialized item types (Equipment, Supply, Kit)
    - Equipment: Serial number tracking, maintenance
    - Supply: Lot tracking, expiration
    - Kit: Component management, assembly

### 3.2 Encapsulation
- Private inventory operations
    - Stock level updates
    - Price calculations
    - Serial number assignments
- Protected data integrity
    - Validation rules
    - Business logic constraints
    - Audit trail maintenance

### 3.3 Polymorphism
- Common interfaces for different item types
    - getPrice(): Different calculation methods
    - updateStock(): Type-specific stock updates
    - validate(): Type-specific validation rules
- Strategy pattern for pricing models
    - Rental pricing
    - Sale pricing
    - Insurance pricing

### 3.4 Abstraction
- High-level inventory operations
    - Transfer between locations
    - Kit assembly/disassembly
    - Stock adjustments
- Service layer abstraction
    - Database operations
    - Business rules
    - Event handling

## 4. Dependencies

### 4.1 Internal Dependencies
- Order Domain: Order fulfillment
- Medical Domain: Equipment certifications
- Billing Domain: Pricing and costs
- Company Domain: Warehouses, locations

### 4.2 External Dependencies
- SQLAlchemy: Database ORM
- FastAPI: API framework
- Pydantic: Data validation
- Redis: Cache for stock levels

## 5. Integration Points

### 5.1 APIs
- RESTful endpoints for inventory operations
- Real-time stock level queries
- Batch update interfaces
- Serial number lookup services

### 5.2 Events
- Stock level changes
- Serial number status updates
- Kit assembly notifications
- Reorder point alerts

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Data Protection
- Serial number encryption
- Cost information protection
- Audit trail security
- Access control by location

### 6.2 Operation Security
- Stock adjustment authorization
- Transfer approval workflows
- Serial number validation
- Kit assembly verification

## 7. Performance Requirements

### 7.1 Response Times
- Stock level queries: < 100ms
- Item lookups: < 200ms
- Batch updates: < 2s
- Serial number validation: < 300ms

### 7.2 Scalability
- Support for millions of items
- Multiple warehouse operations
- Concurrent stock updates
- Real-time inventory tracking

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Tests
- Stock calculation logic
- Pricing computations
- Validation rules
- Kit assembly logic

### 8.2 Integration Tests
- Stock movement workflows
- Serial number tracking
- Kit operations
- Warehouse transfers

## 9. Implementation Phases

### 9.1 Phase 1: Core Inventory
- Basic item management
- Stock level tracking
- Simple pricing
- Location management

### 9.2 Phase 2: Serial Numbers
- Equipment tracking
- Status management
- History tracking
- Maintenance records

### 9.3 Phase 3: Kits
- Kit definitions
- Assembly/disassembly
- Component tracking
- Kit pricing

### 9.4 Phase 4: Advanced Features

- Predictive analytics
- Mobile integration
- Barcode/RFID support

## 10. Risk Analysis

### 10.1 Technical Risks
- Concurrent stock updates
- Data consistency across locations
- Real-time availability accuracy
- Integration complexity

### 10.2 Mitigation Strategies
- Optimistic locking
- Event-driven architecture
- Cache management
- Comprehensive testing
