# Order Domain Analysis
## Version: 1.0.0
## Last Updated: 2025-01-12

## 1. Overview
The Order domain handles all aspects of order management in the HME/DME SaaS application. This includes order creation, tracking, fulfillment, and customer satisfaction surveys.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Order Management
- Primary entity for managing customer orders
- Supports multiple order types (Sale, Rental, Repair, Exchange, Return)
- Tracks order status through its lifecycle
- Manages medical and insurance information

### 2.2 Order Details
- Line items within orders
- Quantity and pricing information
- Rental-specific information for rental orders
- Status tracking per line item

### 2.3 Serial Number Tracking
- Tracks individual equipment by serial number
- Manages equipment exchanges and returns
- Links serial numbers to specific order details

### 2.4 Customer Satisfaction
- Surveys for completed orders
- Rating system for different aspects of service
- Follow-up tracking for customer feedback

## 3. OOP Design Principles

### 3.1 Inheritance
- Base model class provides common functionality
- OrderStatus and OrderType enums for type safety
- Extensible design for future order types

### 3.2 Encapsulation
- Private attributes with public accessors
- Business logic encapsulated in service layer
- Data validation in Pydantic schemas

### 3.3 Polymorphism
- Common interface for different order types
- Flexible handling of various order statuses
- Adaptable processing based on order type

### 3.4 Abstraction
- Service layer abstracts database operations
- Router layer abstracts business logic
- Clear separation of concerns
